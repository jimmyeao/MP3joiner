<h1>MP3Joiner</h1>
As the title says, this is for joinging mp3 filers together, nothing fancy.
Add files to the list, drag and drop to reorder then save the output file. It can read the Track Name, title and album art from any of the highlighted files you have and write them to the joined file, or you can supply your own values / art work
